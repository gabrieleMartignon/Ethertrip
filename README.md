__Ethertrip__ is a Web3 App that allow users to book his next vacation through blockchain paying with Eth!

# Functionalities and Features
- Easily book your travel experiences using __Ethereum (ETH)__ on __Sepolia Testnet Network__ as a secure and decentralized payment method, offering a seamless crypto-friendly checkout process.
- All images are stored via the __IPFS decentralized network__, leveraging the power of web3Storage to ensure data permanence, censorship resistance, and distributed access across the blockchain ecosystem.
- The user interface is designed to be intuitive and straightforward, allowing users to navigate the platform effortlessly without any technical barriers, regardless of their experience level.
- Fully responsive design ensures optimal usability across all devices, from desktops to tablets and smartphones, delivering a consistent and engaging experience wherever you are.

# Technologies Integrated
- __TailwindCSS__, __React__, and __TypeScript__ form the foundation of the frontend architecture. TailwindCSS provides a utility-first approach to styling, enabling rapid UI development with consistent design patterns. React ensures a dynamic and component-based structure, while TypeScript adds strong typing and improved developer tooling for scalability and maintainability.
- __Reown (formerly known as WalletConnect)__ is used as the wallet connection protocol. It allows users to securely link their crypto wallets to the application, supporting a wide range of wallet providers and ensuring compatibility across mobile and desktop platforms.
- __IPFS (InterPlanetary File System)__ is integrated for decentralized file storage. This ensures that all media assets—such as images—are stored in a distributed and censorship-resistant manner. The project utilizes __web3Storage__ as a gateway to interact with IPFS, simplifying the upload and retrieval process while maintaining decentralization.
- __React Router__ is employed to manage client-side routing, enabling smooth navigation between different views and components without full page reloads. This contributes to a more fluid and responsive user experience.
- __Ethers.js__ is used to handle all blockchain-related logic including transaction creation. It provides a lightweight and intuitive API for working with Ethereum and other EVM-compatible networks, making it easier to integrate blockchain functionality into the application.
